# secquence-solver
A python project that predicts the rest of a given sequence.

The main function for this project is predict_rest(). Give it at least 3 terms of a simple integer sequence, and it will predict the next five terms.

Uses an evolutionary learning algorithm to improve the accuracy of random functions over generations via mutation, and random crossover of parent functions.
